# Etch-A-Sketch

Welcome to Etch-A-Sketch, a browser-based sketchpad project where you can unleash your creativity by drawing on a grid!

## Project Overview

Etch-A-Sketch is a project designed to practice DOM manipulation using HTML, CSS (with Flexbox), and JavaScript. It allows users to draw on a grid of squares by hovering over them, creating a pixelated trail reminiscent of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** Generate a customizable grid of squares using JavaScript.
- **Hover Effect:** Change the color of grid squares on hover to simulate drawing.
- **Reset Grid:** Clear the current grid and create a new one with a specified number of squares per side.
- **Extra Credit Features:**
  - **Random RGB Colors:** Squares change to random RGB colors on hover.
  - **Progressive Darkening:** Each hover darkens the square progressively until fully black.
